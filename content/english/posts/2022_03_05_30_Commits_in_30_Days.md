title: 30 Commits in 30 Days

 This past month has been a whirlwind. Right now I'm in my first week of a study abroad program in Chile, which I hope will be a life-changing experience. But because the Chilean school semester starts so much later than our American schedule, I came home for Chirstmas and had little to do until leaving in late February.

So one night as I was journaling, I decided to set some goals for myself. My pen moved with a mind of its own and wrote:

30 Commits in 30 Days

Thing is, I didn't even know what a commit was. I barely knew how to use `git` outside of cloning a repository. But as a psych major turned autodidactic IT student, I knew version control was an essential skill I'd need to learn if I ever hoped to land a job.

The next day, I woke up and had a vague idea of where to start. I had set up a Github account the previous semester to share class projects with prospective employers. I'd also been lurking in some open source communities for a couple of months.

I decided to contribute to [Dasharo](https://www.dasharo.com), an open-source firmware distribution based on coreboot. It's a super cool project focused on removing as much proprietary code from motherboard firmware as possible. If you are familiar with libreboot, it's somewhat similar except that Dasharo supports more modern hardware and has a small company, 3MDEB, behind its long term development. Dasharo is also significantly easier to install, even for a relatively inexperienced user like me. I installed Dasharo firmware on my MSI PRO Z690-A and loved it, so I figured it'd be cool to give back to the community.

The first day, I started out small. I found a typo in their documentation that'd been bugging me for a while and used Github's handy web interface to clone the repository, create a branch, commit the edit, and submit a pull request. I frankly had no idea what I was doing but with trial and error I figured things out. The following days went much the same, correcting small typos and grammar issues as I learned the ropes.

A couple of days into the challenge I figured I'd start a blog, which you're reading right now. This is when I really got into the minutiae, learning how to add, commit, push, and pull changes from the terminal. I spun up an AWS Lightsail instance, bought a domain name, configured DNS, and started configuring the NGINX web server. I also had to brush up on my HTML/CSS, and soon the scope of my project was broadening far beyond learning how to use version control.

I had to take a break from the challenge as I prepared to study abroad, and since arriving in Chile the internet service has been a bit spotty. So while I initially hopped to make 30 commits in 30 days, I barely missed that goal. Still, it was an awesome learning experience and I got a cool website out of it too.

It's better to start somewhere rather than not at all, so welcome to the blog.
