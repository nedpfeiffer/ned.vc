This is the repository for my personal website.

Helpful resources I consulted creating the blog:

[Fedfree - Nginx web server on Debian with LetsEncrypt HTTPS and Certbot](https://fedfree.org/docs/http/debian-nginx.html)

[Nginx - Serving static content](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/serving-static-content/)
